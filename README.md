> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." — Richard Feynman

**FPSZERO** is the digital node of my research lab. It is not just a portfolio; it is a live execution environment for **First Principle Synthesis**—deconstructing complex systems (Cybersecurity, Nature, Physics) into their fundamental truths and rebuilding them from the ground up.

## 📡 The Mission
We decode nature and our own biology, then rebuild them in circuits, code, and metal. This lab applies that philosophy to digital security and computational physics.

### 🛡️ Current Protocol: Identity Defense Ecosystem
**Status:** *Stealth / Active Development*
Building an AI-driven **Anti-Phishing Ecosystem** that moves beyond simple blacklist filtering.
- **Hypothesis:** Phishing is not a technical flaw; it is a cognitive exploit.
- **Solution:** A browser-based anomaly detection engine that uses local multi-headed attention models to detect semantic irregularities in real-time.
- **Constraint:** Zero Latency. Zero PII Involvement. First Principles Privacy.

### 🌌 Event Horizon: Quantum & Deep Compute
Exploration into the probabilistic nature of information.
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Visualizing wave function collapse and superposition.
- **Neuromorphic Computing:** Bridging the gap between biological synapses and silicon gates.

## 💻 The Cosmic Engine (Site Architecture)
This interface (`fpszero.com`) is a proving ground for **Web-Native High-Fidelity Simulation**.
- **No Frameworks:** Built on Vanilla JS and WebGL (Three.js). We do not rely on abstraction layers we do not control.
- **Real-Time Astro-Telemetry:** The moon phase and position you see on-site are calculated in real-time based on UTC celestial mechanics, not static assets.
- **Terminal Gateway:** A fully functional shell environment for direct system interaction.
